##Research Questions
1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservations cancellation?
2. How can we make hotel reservations cancellation better?
3. How will hotels be assisted in making pricing and promotional decisions?

##Hypothesis
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of clients come from office travel agents to make their reservations.


##Suggestions

1.	Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellation of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the customers.
2.	As the ratio of cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotels is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So, the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays. 
3.	In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month. 
4.	They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
